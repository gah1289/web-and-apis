What is HTTP?
-HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or how browsers and servers communicate. It is the protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents.

What is a URL?
-A URL is a uniform resource locator. It turns into:
    A protocol (http)
    hostname (site.com)
    port (80)
    resource (/home.html)
    query (?x=1)

What is DNS?
-DNS is a domain name service that turns a domain name (i.e. google.com) into an IP address.

What is a query string?
-A query string is a part of a URL that provides "extra information" in terms of search terms, information from forms, etc. 

What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
-POST: used to create new resources. When it is successful, the return HTTP status is 201, returning a location header with a link to the newly-created resource. POSTS requests have side effects, i.e. they change data on the server. 
-GET: used to read (or retrieve) a representation of a resource. If there is no error, GET returns a representation in XML or JSON and an HTTP response code of 200 (ok). GET requests don't change server data.

What is an HTTP request?
-A request makes a request to a secure web server. This is almost always a GET request and contains the exact URL you want. A request contains a method (GET), HTTP protocol version (1.1), resource URL, and headers.

What is an HTTP response?
-A response is what the request returns with the exact HTML for the requested page. It includes an HTTP protocol version (1.1), response status code, and its headers include the date/time the server thinks it is, any cookies the server wabts to set, any cachine information, etc. 

What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
-HTTP headers let the client and server pass additional information with an HTTP  request or response. It consists of its case-sensitive name followed by a colon, then by its value. 
-A request header includes the hostname you're asking about, the date your browser thinks it is, language your browser wants the information in, any cookies the server has sent, etc. 
-A response header includes content type (text/html), date/time the server thinks it is, any cookies the server wants to set, any caching information, etc.

What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
-This scheme (https://) tells the browser to make a connection to the server using Transport Layer Security, or TLS.
-The path directs the user to the intended webpage
-The browser looks up the IP address for the domain.
-The browser initiates the TCP (transmission control protocol) with the server
-The browser sends the HTTP request to the server
-The server processes the request and sends back a response (200 means OK, 404 means not found, etc.)
-The browser renders the content by inspecting the headers.
